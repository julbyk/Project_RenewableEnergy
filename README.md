The Effect of Renewable Energy sources on micro climates

** Introduction

Global energy demand is increasing, making renewable energy sources critical to future sustainable power supply. Land-based wind and solar electricity generation plans are rapidly expanding, and they are assumed to have little effect on the environment. Although the understanding of their operational effects on local ecosystems is limited.
Wind turbines and photovoltaic panels can significantly change local ground-level climate by a magnitude that could affect the fundamental atmosphere-plantâ€“soil processes. We believe that understanding the possible effects of changes in ground-level microclimates on these phenomena is crucial to reducing uncertainty of the true renewable energy cost and to maximize beneficial effects.
We will be lookiing into renewable energy power plants around the world, and correlate its location and power outputs with the data on climate, atmospheric conditions, local weather and vegetation, air quality and pollution levels.
