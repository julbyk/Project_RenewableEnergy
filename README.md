The Effect of Renewable Energy sources on micro climates

## Introduction

Global energy demand is increasing, making renewable energy sources critical to future sustainable power supply. Land-based wind and solar electricity generation plans are rapidly expanding. 75% of wind power plants and 95% of solar plants are built and deployed only last 10%. These plants are assumed to have little effect on the environment, although the understanding of their operational effects on local ecosystems is limited.
Wind turbines and photovoltaic panels can significantly change local ground-level climate by a magnitude that could affect the fundamental atmosphere-plantâ€“soil processes. We believe that understanding the possible effects is crucial to reducing uncertainty of the true renewable energy cost and to maximize beneficial effects. This project is aiming to detect and predict the effects of the renewable energy sources, as well as suggest strategies to reduce the negative impact by studying multiple cases. We will be looking into renewable energy power plants around the world, and correlate its location and power outputs with the data on climate, atmospheric conditions, local weather and vegetation, air quality and pollution levels. The resutls will be benefitical for the nation-wide planning of locating renewable energy plants, it will also be important for individual that are installing renewable energy generators on their properties. 

## Exploratory study of local climate for Alta Wind Energy Center wind farm

For the exploratory study I have searched and determined the example of the wind power plant, and demostrated the its effect on the local climate.
